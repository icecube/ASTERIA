===========================================
Unified Supernova Simulation Routine (USSR)
===========================================

Introduction
------------

This is a fast supernova neutrino simulation designed for the IceCube Neutrino
Observatory. The original version was written in C++ by Thomas Kowarik and
Gösta Kroll at Universität Mainz in 2011, and has been updated by Lutz Köpke.
This project began as a Python port of the original USSR.

The code uses estimates of the supernova neutrino luminosity from large-scale
simulations of core-collapse supernovae to calculate photons in the IceCube
detector.
